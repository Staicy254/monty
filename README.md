0x19 -Stacks, Queues- LIFO, FIFO
A stack is a list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end, caleed the top.
Operations in this include:
Push - insertion of an element in a stack.
Top - returns an element at the top of a stack
Pop - removing the most recent element from the stack
IsEmpty - checks if the stack is empty ,using boolean shows false if otherwise.
All these work in Constant time or 0(1).
Stack is used for execution of function calls in a program.
Also used for  recursion.
Theses are implemented using arrays and linked lists.
