*0x19 -Stacks, Queues- LIFO, FIFO*
- A stack is a list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end, caleed the top.
- Operations in this include:
	1. Push - insertion of an element in a stack.
	2. Top - returns an element at the top of a stack
	3. Pop - removing the most recent element from the stack
	4. IsEmpty - checks if the stack is empty ,using boolean shows false if otherwise.
- All these work in Constant time or 0(1).
- Stack is used for execution of function calls in a program.
- Also used for  recursion.
- These are implemented using arrays and linked lists.
